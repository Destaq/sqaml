  A basic custom relational database implemented entirely in OCaml,
  using file storage with .sqaml syntax for persisting data.
  Implements a SQL parser with general database and table functions
  as you might expect à la PostgreSQL.

  This includes insert, delete, update, join, foreign keys, where, and from.
  
  Additionally, we support running a SQL file or loading in a .sqaml file
  to some query-able “database”. Standard SQL syntax can be used in the CLI.
